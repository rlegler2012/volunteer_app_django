## Description
* Users are able to view a model list of various dental professionals and submitted volunteer locations related to that field.

* Full stack CRUD website.

* Ability to search through the list of various dental professionals.

## Technologies Used
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* PostgreSQL
* Django
* Python


## Next Steps: Planned future enhancements
* User profile
* When creating venue location: include date/time, event name, venue location, and link to signup (eventually I would like to be able to pull from an external API that already has all the data for volunteer opportunities).
* Create a model for State requirements for licensing that then links to Dental Professionals model
* Improvement in CSS and layout of design
* Links to websites that others can donate supplies or funds, even if not a dental professional
* Model for non-dental professionals to be able to sign up to help at volunteer events (i.e paperwork, check-in and out, etc.)
* Dental education model for those looking for educational tools and possibly locations for free or reduced dental care
* Make it SOCIAL - create a posting/commenting section so users can share past experiences or future event information, etc
